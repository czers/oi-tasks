The purpose of this repository is to be a convenient stash with examplary
solutions of the tasks from Polish Olympiad in Informatics. Most of the time
these solutions have been created just to get task done as simply and fast
as possible, so don't expect many programming pearls among them.

All source files in this repository have been written by me. You are free to
do whatever you want with them.
